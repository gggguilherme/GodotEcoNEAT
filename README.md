# GodotEcoNEAT
 Real-time NEAT Implementation with Godot, simulating a simple ecosystem.

Hmmmm it's a bit VERY LAGGY when the population starts increasing a lot.

I don't really care to correct all the bugs in this project, it was always meant to be a quick demo project so I could learn what I needed for a new game I'm making.

That also means, anyone is free to fork it, stab it, murder it, and help it become a cool godot library asset.
