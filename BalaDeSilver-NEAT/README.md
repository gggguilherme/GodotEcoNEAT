# github.com/BalaDeSilver/NEAT_GDScript

This is the example I tried to follow to make my own version of NEAT for godot, but with a twist.

I saw it being called "rt-NEAT" for Real Time NEAT algorithm in a great video showcasing the software "The Bibites" where you experiment with a real time natural selection environment. I think it's cool!

And this script was developed to be the main mechanic for a videogame I'm developing myself about evolution of species.
